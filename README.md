# Defense System

This project is a Java-based simulation of a defense system that uses the **Observer Design Pattern** to manage communication and interaction between various defense units and a central controller. This project includes GUI for each unit, providing an interactive platform to monitor and manage operations.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Implements object-oriented principles for scalability and maintainability.
- **Dynamic Communication**: Uses the Observer Pattern for efficient state management and message broadcasting.
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**: Provides intuitive interfaces for interacting with the defense units.
- **Centralized Control**: A `MainController` coordinates operations and integrates with individual units.
